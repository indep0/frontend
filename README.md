# How to run this project

It's important to use at the same time with the [Indep0 Backend](https://github.com/indep0/backend) and have installed docker and node as well.

In the project directory, you can run `start`, the most commun way to initialize the app in live mode:

#### `npm start`

If you want more options the `package.json` file always is available for request differents types of scripts.

If you prefer use docker the Dockerfile is allready configured to use.
